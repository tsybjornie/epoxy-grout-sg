### POST 1 — Value-First (Best for groups with strict rules)

```
Hey everyone! Just wanted to share some info that might help if you're dealing with grout issues.

After doing 500+ homes across Singapore, these are the 3 most common grout problems I see:

1️⃣ Black/moldy grout in bathrooms — Usually caused by trapped moisture. Normal cleaning only works temporarily.

2️⃣ Crumbling grout between tiles — Cement grout degrades over time, especially in wet areas (5-8 years).

3️⃣ Water seeping under tiles — Often the grout has broken down and lost its waterproofing.

The permanent fix? Epoxy grout. It's waterproof, mold-resistant, and we warranty it for 10 years.

If you're curious about pricing for your HDB/condo, I made a free calculator: [YOUR SITE LINK]/quote.html

Happy to answer any questions! 🙂

### POST 3 — Problem Awareness (Educational)

```
PSA for HDB homeowners 🏠

If your bathroom grout looks like this 👇 (black, stained, crumbling) — here's what's actually happening:

Regular cement grout is POROUS. It absorbs water, grows mold from the inside, and breaks down over 5-8 years.

Bleach and scrubbing only clean the surface. The mold is INSIDE the grout.

The only permanent solution:
→ Remove the old grout
→ Replace with epoxy grout (waterproof, non-porous)
→ Lasts 15+ years, warranty 10 years

We've done this for 500+ homes across SG. If you want to check pricing for your flat type, I built a free calculator: [YOUR SITE LINK]/quote.html
