Epoxy grout eliminates it permanently.'; kw = 'mold grout Singapore, black mold bathroom tiles, mold removal grout, anti-mold grout'; cause = 'Singapore''s 80-90% humidity creates the perfect breeding ground for black mold in cement grout. Cement grout is porous - it absorbs water and never fully dries, making it a permanent mold home.'; solution = 'Epoxy grout is 100% non-porous and waterproof. Mold literally cannot grow on it. We remove all existing mold and infected grout, then apply epoxy that stays clean for 15-20 years.'; price = 'From $488'; fq1 = 'Can I just clean the mold instead of regrouting?'; fa1 = 'You can clean it temporarily, but mold in cement grout ALWAYS comes back because the grout is porous - mold lives inside it. Epoxy grout is the only permanent solution because mold cannot penetrate non-porous material.'; fq2 = 'How quickly does mold come back after cleaning?'; fa2 = 'With cement grout, mold typically returns within 2-4 weeks in Singapore climate. With epoxy grout, mold cannot grow at all - many of our customers report zero mold even after years.'; fq3 = 'Is the black mold in my bathroom dangerous?'; fa3 = 'Yes. Black mold (Stachybotrys) can cause respiratory issues, allergies, and skin irritation. It is especially harmful to children and elderly. Removing it permanently with epoxy grout protects your family health.' },

Over time it turns yellow, brown, or black. Time to upgrade to stain-proof epoxy.'; kw = 'stained grout Singapore, yellow grout lines, discolored grout, grout cleaning Singapore'; cause = 'Cement grout is like a sponge. It absorbs cooking oil, soap residue, body oils, coffee spills, and general dirt. Once absorbed, no amount of cleaning can remove deep stains.'; solution = 'Epoxy grout has a glass-smooth, non-porous surface. Nothing can penetrate it. Spills, oil, and dirt wipe clean instantly. Your grout stays the same color for 15-20 years.'; price = 'From $488'; fq1 = 'Can professional grout cleaning fix stained grout?'; fa1 = 'Professional cleaning helps temporarily, but stains in cement grout are absorbed deep into the material. Within weeks to months, stains return. Epoxy regrouting is the permanent fix.'; fq2 = 'My kitchen grout is yellow from cooking oil. Can this be fixed?'; fa2 = 'Absolutely! Kitchen grout staining from cooking oil is extremely common in Singapore. We remove the old stained grout and replace with oil-resistant epoxy that wipes clean easily.'; fq3 = 'What colors does epoxy grout come in?'; fa3 = 'We offer over 30 colors including white, off-white, grey, beige, and custom colors. We help you choose the best color to match your tiles and hide future wear.' },

Fix it before it becomes a major leak.'; kw = 'cracked grout Singapore, grout repair Singapore, crumbling grout fix, grout falling out'; cause = 'Cement grout becomes brittle over time, especially in areas with temperature changes (near ovens, windows) or building movement. Once cracked, water enters and causes tile loosening, mold, and structural damage.'; solution = 'Epoxy grout is flexible and bonds chemically to tiles. It does not crack or crumble. We remove all damaged grout, clean the joints, and apply epoxy that creates a waterproof seal.'; price = 'From $488'; fq1 = 'Is cracked grout a serious problem?'; fa1 = 'Yes! Cracked grout allows water to seep behind tiles, causing hidden mold, tile loosening, and potential water damage to walls and floors. Fix it early before it becomes expensive.'; fq2 = 'Can you fix just the cracked areas or do you need to redo everything?'; fa2 = 'We can do spot repairs, but we recommend full regrouting for best results. Mixing old cement grout with new epoxy creates an uneven look. Full regrouting gives you a uniform, waterproof finish.'; fq3 = 'My grout is crumbling in the shower. Is this normal?'; fa3 = 'It is common but not normal. Shower grout deteriorates faster due to constant water exposure. Epoxy grout is specifically designed for wet areas - it will not crumble or deteriorate.' },

Stop patching - upgrade to permanent epoxy grout.'; kw = 'peeling grout Singapore, flaking grout, grout paint peeling, grout pen not working'; cause = 'Grout pens and grout paint are temporary fixes that peel within weeks to months. They sit on the surface instead of replacing the grout. Similarly, old cement grout eventually flakes as it deteriorates.'; solution = 'We completely remove the old grout (including any paint or pen residue) and apply genuine epoxy grout that bonds permanently. No more peeling, no more touch-ups.'; price = 'From $488'; fq1 = 'I used a grout pen but it peeled off. What should I do?'; fa1 = 'Grout pens are cosmetic only - they paint over the surface without fixing the underlying problem. The paint peels because it cannot bond to porous, deteriorating cement grout. Epoxy regrouting replaces the grout entirely.'; fq2 = 'How long does grout paint or grout pen last?'; fa2 = 'Grout pens and paint typically last 2-8 weeks before peeling, especially in wet areas like bathrooms. Epoxy grout lasts 15-20 years because it IS the grout, not a coating on top.'; fq3 = 'Is epoxy grout better than grout paint?'; fa3 = 'They are completely different things. Grout paint is a surface coating. Epoxy grout is a full replacement material that is waterproof, stain-proof, and permanent. There is no comparison.' },

Epoxy grout creates a waterproof seal.'; kw = 'water leak tiles Singapore, water seeping through grout, bathroom leak repair, tile waterproofing Singapore'; cause = 'When cement grout cracks or deteriorates, water seeps through the joints and behind the tiles. This causes leaks to the floor below, water stains on ceilings, and hidden structural damage.'; solution = 'Epoxy grout creates a 100% waterproof barrier between tiles. We remove all compromised grout, dry the area, and apply waterproof epoxy. Combined with silicone at wall-floor joints, this stops leaks permanently.'; price = 'From $488'; fq1 = 'Can epoxy grout stop a water leak from my bathroom?'; fa1 = 'In most cases, yes. If the leak is caused by water seeping through deteriorated grout lines, replacing with waterproof epoxy grout stops it. If tiles are cracked or waterproofing membrane is damaged, additional work may be needed.'; fq2 = 'My downstairs neighbor is complaining about water stains. Is it my grout?'; fa2 = 'Very likely! Deteriorated bathroom grout is the most common cause of water leaks to downstairs units in HDB flats. A free inspection can confirm if regrouting will fix it.'; fq3 = 'Do I need waterproofing or just regrouting?'; fa3 = 'For most bathrooms, epoxy regrouting is sufficient because epoxy grout itself is waterproof. For severe cases or balconies, we may recommend polyurea waterproof coating in addition to regrouting.' }
